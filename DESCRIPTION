Description: Evaluates moments of ratios (and products) of quadratic forms
    in normal variables, specifically using recursive algorithms developed by
    Bao and Kan (2013) <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2013.03.002> and Hillier et al.
    (2014) <doi:10.1017/S0266466613000364>. Also provides distribution,
    quantile, and probability density functions of simple ratios of quadratic
    forms in normal variables with several algorithms. Originally developed as
    a supplement to Watanabe (2023) <doi:10.1007/s00285-023-01930-8> for
    evaluating average evolvability measures in evolutionary quantitative
    genetics, but can be used for a broader class of statistics. Generating 
    functions for these moments are also closely related to the top-order zonal
    and invariant polynomials of matrix arguments.
