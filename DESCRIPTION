Description: This package provides functions to evaluate moments of ratios
    (and products) of quadratic forms in normal variables, specifically using
    recursive algorithms developed by Hillier, Bao, Kan and colleagues.
    Generating functions for these moments are closely related to the top-order
    zonal and invariant polynomials of matrix arguments.
