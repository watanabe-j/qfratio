\title{Recursion for hhat}
\usage{
hhat2_ij_m(
  A1,
  A2,
  mu = rep.int(0, n),
  m = 100L,

  m2 = m,

}
\description{
\code{hhat2_ij_m()} and \code{hhat2_ij_m()} are recursive algorithms
for truncation error in noncentral case.
}
\details{
These provide recursive algorithms for \eqn{\hat{h}_{i,j}} in
Hillier et al. (2014, theorem 7).  This recursion is said to be very similar
to those for \eqn{h_{i,j}} in the note therein, but differs in the signs
of some terms.
