  series = statistic,
  seq_error = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{statistic}{Terminal value (truncated sum) of the moment.
When missing, obtained as \code{sum(series)}.}

\item{error_bound}{Terminal error bound.
When missing, obtained as \code{seq_error[length(seq_error)]}.}

\item{series}{Series expression for the moment along varying polynomial degrees}

\item{seq_error}{Vector of error bounds corresponding to \code{cumsum(series)}}

\item{exact, twosided, alphaout, singular_arg}{Logicals used to append attributes to the resultant error bound
(see "Value")}

\item{...}{Additional arguments for accommodating subclasses}

\item{class}{Character vector to (pre-)append classes to the return value}
}
\value{
\code{new_qfrm()} and \code{new_qfpm()} return a list of class \code{qfrm}
and \code{c(qfpm, qfrm)}, respectively.
These classes are defined for the \code{print} and \code{plot} methods.

The return object is a list of 4 elements which are intended to be:
\itemize{
\item{\code{$statistic}: }{evaluation result (\code{sum(series)})}
\item{\code{$series}: }{vector of \eqn{0}th to \eqn{m}th order terms}
\item{\code{$error_bound}: }{error bound of \code{statistic}}
\item{\code{$seq_error}: }{vector of error bounds corresponding to
partial sums (\code{cumsum(series)})}
}
When the result is exact, \code{$series} is of length 1 and equal to
\code{$statistic}, so only the latter is of practical importance.
This is always the case for the \code{qfpm} class.

When the relevant flags are provided in the constructor, \code{$error_bound}
and \code{$seq_error} have the following attributes which control behaviors
of the \code{print} and \code{plot} methods:
\itemize{
\item{\code{"exact"}: }{Indicates the moment is exact}
\item{\code{"twosided"}: }{Indicates the error bounds are two-sided}
\item{\code{"alphaout"}: }{Indicates whether any of the scaling parameters
(\code{alphaA}, \code{alphaB}, \code{alphaD}) is outside
0 and 1, in which case error bound does not strictly hold}
\item{\code{"singular"}: }{Indicates whether the relevant argument matrix
is (numerically) singular, in which case the error bound is
invalid}
}

\description{
These are internal ``constructor'' functions used to make \code{qfrm} and
\code{qfpm} objects, which are used as a return value from the
\code{\link{qfrm}}, \code{\link{qfmrm}}, and \code{\link{qfpm}} functions.
